# mexico_pop
Repository for Mexico's population stuff. 

Script 01 creates a function that allows the production of population pyramid plots for every municipality in Mexico for every year between 1990 and 2040. Once again, this is thanks to [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/2024/07/population-pyramid-part-2).

The source of th data is Mexico's National Population Council (CONAPO), specifically, the [Reconstruction and Proyections of Mexico's municipalities population 1990-2024](https://www.gob.mx/conapo/documentos/reconstruccion-y-proyecciones-de-la-poblacion-de-los-municipios-de-mexico-1990-2040). This soource presents the reconstructions or the proyections for the mid-year population for all of 2,475 municiplaities in Mexico for the years 1990 to 2040.

This scripts will be used in other repositories that need to use Mexico's population (i.e. sesnsp).
